        "This given project is all about Hotel Booking data Analysis. Which contains the real world data record of hotel bookings of a city and a resort hotel containing details like bookings, cancellations, guest details etc. It has 119390 rows and 32 columns. Main aim of the project is to understand and visualize dataset from hotel and customer point of view i.e. reasons for booking cancellations across various parameters, best time to book hotel, peak season and give suggestions to reduce these cancellations and increase revenue of hotels. The main objective of this project is to explore and analyze data to discover important factors that govern the bookings and give insights to the hotel management, which can perform various campaigns to boost the business and performance. In this project we will be dividing the data manipulation workflow in three category i.e Data collections, Data cleaning, Data manipuation, and EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis). In Data collections first step to find the different columns which is done by coding info(), describe(), columns(), and some other method which is used for data collections. We can also update some functions i.e hotel, is_cancelled, lead_time,arrival_date_year, arrival_date,month, arrival_date,week, number, arrival_date_week_number, arrival_date_day_of_months, stays_in_weekend_nights. Before Visualize any data from the data set we have to do data wrangling. For that, we will check the null values of the columnns. After checking, we will a get a column which includes more numbers of null values, and dropping that column by using 'drop' method. In this manner, we dropped the 'company' column. When we find the minimal numbers of null values with necessary values, fill these null values with necessary values as per requirement by using.fillna().\n",
        "Different charts are used for data visualization so that better insights and business objective is attained."
